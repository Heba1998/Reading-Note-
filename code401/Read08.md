# ***OO Design***

## ***General code design principles:***

*object-oriented design principles help you write flexible and better code by striving high cohesion and low coupling.*


* *Don't repeat yourself -> `DRY`*

Is a principle of software development means donâ€™t write duplicate code, instead use Abstraction to abstract everyday things in one place.

If you have a block of code in more than two places, consider making it a separate method, or if you use a hard-coded value more than one time, make them public final constant. The benefit of this Object-oriented design principle is in maintenance.

* *Rule of three*

```
Rule of three is a code refactoring rule of thumb to decide when a replicated piece of code should be replaced by a new procedure. It states that the code can be copied once, but that when the same code is used three times, it should be extracted into a new procedure. 
```

* *You aren't gonna need it -> `YAGNI`*

```
is a principle of extreme programming (XP) .The idea of YAGNI is that you shouldn't add functionality to a program until you actually need it.

* *Minimum viable product*

```
Minimum Viable Product or MVP is a development technique in which a new product is introduced in the market with basic features, but enough to get the attention of the consumers. The final product is released in the market only after getting sufficient feedback from the product's initial users.

MVP has three distinct features. One is that it will have enough features for consumers to purchase the product (it becomes easier for the company to market it), the other is that it will have some sort of a feedback mechanism wherein users would be able to send their feedback about the product. And, lastly it should have enough future benefits for consumers who to adopt the product first.
