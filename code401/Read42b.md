**It can be hard to imagine that many of the applications and programs we use today are built by hundreds of thousands, even millions, of people all over the world. Open-source software (OSS) is a rapidly growing industry that provides many benefits to the individuals and businesses who use it, as well as to its programmers.**

* *here are some of the most common reasons why developers contribute to open-source software:*

   1. Improve Coding Skills:  For developers, contributing to OSS means that they not only practice their programming skills, but that they also learn and gain feedback from more accomplished programmers. This jumping-in-the-deep-end style of learning provides aspiring programmers with real-life, first-hand experience and greatly accelerates their learning curve.

   2. Gain Early Experience:  Contributing to OSS allows developers to become better at reading code produced by others, finding and fixing bugs, and adding their code into the main repository. These are all activities developers experience working in a tech company.

   3. Increase Community and Peer Recognition:  Many developers are extremely determined to become the best developer they can be to meet certain personal goals, and having your code accepted by a big OSS project is a considered a massive achievement.

   4. Greater Job Prospects:  In the same way contributing to OSS can help you increase your chances of landing an internship, it can also improve your job and career prospects.

   5. Improve Software on a User and Business Level.





## **Google and AI**

*Actually I agree with this article and with the google decision for leaving the Maven project, a Pentagon pilot program that uses artificial intelligence to analyze drone footage. 
It is better to use AI For the public interest instead of its participation in the arms industry.*

*What stuck out to me is that employees at the company have spent months protesting Google’s involvement in Project Maven, sending a letter to Pichai demanding that Google terminate its contract with the Department of Defense. Several employees even resigned in protest, concerned that Google was aiding the development of autonomous weapons systems.*


## **Cyber-Security of self driving cars**

*Honestly, I'm not totally against self-driving cars because it could help people but It hard to trust going in these cars in all places, But in sure I'm against the cars that need some sort of internet-connectivity for its functionality, because they will be vulnerable to those that regularly disrupt computer networks, like data thieves of personal and financial information, spoofers who present incorrect information to a vehicle, and denial-of-service attacks that move from shutting down computers to shutting down cars.*

*In addition, new threats unique to automated vehicles themselves emerge—hackers who would take control over or shut-down a vehicle, criminals who could ransom a vehicle or its passengers, and thieves who direct a self-driving car to relocate itself to the local chop-shop, for example.*

*Finally, there are security threats to the wide-ranging networks that will connect with autonomous vehicles—the financial networks that process tolls and parking payments, the roadway sensors, cameras and traffic signals, the electricity grid, and even our personal home networks.*
