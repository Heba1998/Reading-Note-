## What is Amazon S3?

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is storage for the Internet. Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface that you can use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, and inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites.

* **Buckets**
A bucket is a container for objects stored in Amazon S3. Every object is contained in a bucket. Buckets serve several purposes:


* **Objects**

Objects are the fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3. An object is uniquely identified within a bucket by a key (name) and a version ID.

* **Keys**

A key is the unique identifier for an object within a bucket. Every object in a bucket has exactly one key.

* **Regions**

You can choose the geographical AWS Region where Amazon S3 will store the buckets that you create.
