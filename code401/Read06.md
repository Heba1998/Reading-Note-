* *Objects*

```
are the main core of the oop programming, anything that we can see and interact with is an object, every object has states(fields) and behaviors(methods) some of benefits to use the objects in the programming Enhance the (Modularity,Information hiding, reusability and the Pluggability)
```

* *Class*

```
are the blueprints that make or create each individual object
```

* *Inheritance*

```
is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.
```

* *Interface*

```
An interface declaration can contain method signatures, default methods, static methods and constant definitions. The only methods that have implementations are default and static methods.
```

* *Package*

```
is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces, Because software written in the Java programming language can be composed of hundreds or thousands of individual classes, it makes sense to keep things organized by placing related classes and interfaces into packages.

## ***Interfaces and Inheritance***

```
An interface declaration consists of modifiers, the keyword interface, the interface name, a comma-separated list of parent interfaces (if any), and the interface body.

Interface is a reference type, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types.

You can use interface names anywhere you can use any other data type name. If you define a reference variable whose type is an interface, any object you assign to it must be an instance of a class that implements the interface.

Multiple inheritance of implementation is the ability to inherit method definitions from multiple classes. Java supports multiple inheritance of type, which is the ability of a class to implement more than one interface.
