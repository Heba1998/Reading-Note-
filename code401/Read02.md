* *Java classes can be grouped to gether in packages but what is the package?A package name is the same as the directory (folder) name which contains the .java files.*

* *To import java package into a class, we need to use java import keyword which is used to access package and its classes into the java program. Use import to access built-in and user-defined packages into your java source file so that your class can refer to a class that is in another package by directly using its name.*

## ***Loops***

* the type of loops that we will use in Java:

  * For loop: *for loop provides a concise way of writing the loop structure. Unlike a while loop, a for statement consumes the initialization, condition and increment/decrement in one line thereby providing a shorter, easy to debug structure of looping.*

  ***

for (initialization condition; testing condition;increment/decrement)

{

    statements

}
  ***

* while loop: *A while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement.*

***
while (boolean condition)

{

   loop statements...

}
***

* do-while loop: *do while loop is similar to while loop with only difference that it checks for condition after executing the statements, and therefore is an example of Exit Control Loop.*

***
do

{

    statements..

}

while (condition);
