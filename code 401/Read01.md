# **Java Basics**

## ***Variables***

* The Java programming language defines the following kinds of variables: 

  - Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields) : are non-static variables and are declared in a class outside any method, constructor,…or block. As instance variables are declared in a class, these variables are created when an object of the class is created and destroyed when the object is destroyed.

  - Class Variables (Static Fields) :  their values will never change.

  - Local Variables : There is no special keyword designating a variable as local; that determination comes entirely from the location in which the variable is declared — which is between the opening and closing braces of a method.



## ***operators***

- In general-purpose programming, certain operators tend to appear more frequently than others; for example, the assignment operator "=" is far more common than the unsigned right shift operator ">>>". 



## ***Expressions***

- An expression is a construct made up of variables, operators, and method invocations

- Statements are roughly equivalent to sentences in natural languages. A statement forms a complete unit of execution
 
   - expression statements
   - declaration statements
   - control flow statements


- A block is a group of zero or more statements between balanced braces and can be used anywhere a single statement is allowed.





## ***Control Flow Statements***

* The statements inside your source files are generally executed from top to bottom, in the order that they appear. Control flow statements, however, break up the flow of execution by employing decision making, looping, and branching, enabling your program to conditionally execute particular blocks of code. This section describes the decision-making statements (if-then, if-then-else, switch), the looping statements (for, while, do-while), and the branching statements (break, continue, return) supported by the Java programming language.
