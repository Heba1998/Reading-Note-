* *Who is Roy Fielding?*

`the one who created the HTTP specification.`

* *Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?*

`I think, Because they weren't designed to be used like that`

* *What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?*

`HTTP is the protocol used to transfer data over the web , it is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.`


* *What does a `GET` do?*

`GET is used for viewing something, without changing it`


* *What does a `POST` do?*

`If one system needs to add something to another system`

* *What does PUT do?*

`PUT method is used to update resource available on the server.`

* *What does PATCH do?*

`partial update`
