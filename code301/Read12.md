**Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:**

|SQL|NoSQL|
|---|------|
relational| non-relational
structured query language and have a predefined schema|have dynamic schemas for unstructured data
vertically scalable|horizontally scalable
table based|document, key-value, graph or wide-column stores
better for multi-row transactions| better for unstructured data like documents or JSON

* *What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?*

`table based data.`

* *Give a real world example.*

`Oracle Express Edition`


* *What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?*

`document based, key-value pairs, graph databases`


* *Give a real world example.*

`MongoDB`

* *Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?*

`NoSQL database`

* *Which type of database is best for scalability?*

`SQL database`

* *What does SQL stand for?*


`Structured Query Language.`


* *What is a realational database?*

`It's a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.`

* *What type of structure does a relational database work with?*

`works with tables.`


* *What is a `schema`?*

`A cognitive framework or concept that helps organize and interpret information`

* *What is a NoSQL database?*

`An approach to database design that provides flexible schemas for the storage and retrieval of data beyond the traditional table structures found in relational databases.`

* *Howo does it work?*

`Each of the systems labelled with the generic name works differently, but the basic idea is to offer better scalability and performance by using DB models that don't support all the functionality of a generic RDBMS, but still enough functionality to be useful. In a way it's like MySQL, which at one time lacked support for transactions but, exactly because of that, managed to outperform other DB systems. If you could write your app in a way that didn't require transactions, it was great.`

* *What is inside of a Mongo database?*

`We have collections instead of tables, and inside collections we have documents.`

* *Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.*

`MongoDB, because it has no specific schema. Also, there are no relations`


* *What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?*

`when you want to update a spcific data, you have to update all collections that contain that data.`
