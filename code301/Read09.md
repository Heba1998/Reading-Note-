* *What is functional programming?*

`Functional programming is a programming paradigm a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.`

* *What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?*

`It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic), It does not cause any observable side effects`


* *What are the benefits of a pure function?*

```
* easy to reason about
* easy to combine
* easy to test
* easy to debug
* easy to parallelize

```

* *What is immutability?*

`are the objects whose state cannot be changed once the object is created.`


* *What is Referential transparency?*

`Referential Transparency is the property that lets you replace an expression with its value, and not change the results of whatever you were doing.`

* *What is a module?*


`that is a component that you would to use it outside his original file.`


* *What does the word ‘require’ do?*

`import the file`

* *How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?*

`first thing module export then in the page we need to use it we should import it by (require )`


* *What do we have to do to make a module available?*

`export it firstly from its original file, then import it to the new file by require.`
